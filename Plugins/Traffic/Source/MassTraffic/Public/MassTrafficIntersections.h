	/**
	 * NOTE ON HIDDEN SIDES -
	 * Right before the Alpha release, some intersections (including the one at player start) were found where two bad
	 * things were happening - 
	 *		(1) In some intersections identified as being 2-sided or 4-sided (meaning having 2 or 4 inbound sides),
	 *		    more than one side would open for traffic at the same time, and some of the vehicles would exit the
	 *		    intersection through one or more *other hidden sides* that I never accounted for, at the same time,
	 *		    sometimes colliding. (2 and 4 sided intersections can have more than one inbound side open for traffic.)
	 *		(2) The pedestrian crosswalk lanes on those sides were also never being opened to pedestrians when the
	 *			traffic cleared, so pedestrians would be waiting forever there.
	 * These cases happened because the 'other hidden sides' never had an associated inbound side built for them, since
	 * these sides don't have any inbound lanes. And only inbound sides knew which pedestrian lanes they blocked and
	 * unblocked - where their lanes were inbound.
	 * To fix this, I added the notion of 'hidden sides'. Now I can identify those intersections that have these hidden
	 * sides, and find which points / into-intersection directions are part of those hidden sides.
	 * Then, to solve the problems related to hidden sides -
	 *		(1) These intersections with hidden (outbound-only) sides always now have their periods built as general
	 *			(round-robin) intersections. Only one inbound side will ever be open, so traffic won't collide on the
	 *			hidden (outbound-only) sides.
	 *		(2) For these intersections with hidden (outbound-only) sides, the pedestrian lanes that vehicles cross when
	 *			travelling over these hidden sides will be included in opening of the pedestrians lanes.
	 * Overwhelmingly, most intersections *do not* end up with hidden (outbound-only) sides.
